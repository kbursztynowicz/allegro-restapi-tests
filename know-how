In order to implement those two REST API tests, I have used Java8, Junit, Maven, RestAssured as main technologies.
Basic configuration can be defined in the RestAPIConfig class (base URI).
HeaderRestAPITest class contains a test that checks if request header contains desired value of an header element
 upon calling head method on /posts endpoint.
ResponseEmailValidatorTest class has defined a test that calls get method on /comments endpoint and extracts collection of email addresses.Then
 all email addresses are checked for their format correctness.
In order to run a test, right-click on a class containing @Test annotaion and select 'Run' from the context-menu.
